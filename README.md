# My Beautify README

This extension designed to beautify Javascript code according to my syntax rules.

## Features

- Spaceify - creates equal space between multiple variables declaration and their value.
- Order Imports - Order import statements by length from the shortest one to the longest one.
- Vars Rename - Replaces all variables declaration declared by 'var' to 'let' as ES6 standards.
- Constify - Replaces declaration of all variables that have a constant value to 'const' as ES6 standards.

## Extension Settings

- `myBeautify.beautify`: Apply all the beautify fixes.
- `myBeautify.spaceify`: Create equal space between multiple variables declaration and their value.
- `myBeautify.orderImports`: Order import statements by length.
- `myBeautify.varsRename`: Replace all variables declaration declared by 'var' to 'let' as ES6 standards.

## Note
